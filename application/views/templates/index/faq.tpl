						<a name='willSomeone'><strong>Will someone come to fish with us?</strong></a><br/>
Yes, your boat will have a Captain and an experienced fisherman to sail the boat, supply all the gear and help you with anything you need.<br/><br/> 
<a name='canICome'><strong>Can I come if I have no fishing experience?</strong></a>
You can and you should! We will supply and help you set up all the rods and baits, teach you how to grab the fish and get it in the boat. You will have as much or as little assistance as you wish, to make your experience both challenging and fun!<br/><br/>
<a name='doWeNeedTo'><strong>Do we need to bring our own gear or equipment?</strong></a>
No, we supply all the equipment you need. However, you do need to bring a big cooler to take your catch home!<br/><br/>
<a name='howManyPeople'><strong>How many people can come?</strong></a>
We allow parties up to 12 people, arranging fishing trips in two shifts. Our lodging in beautiful Manistee may be a comfortable place for you to rest, cook and enjoy your time near Lake Michigan, as the other half of your party is out fishing.<br/><br/> 
<a name='canChildrenCome'><strong>Can children come?</strong></a>
Yes, children are welcome! <br/><br/>
<a name='whatIfWeNeed'><strong>What if we need to come back early, or if someone gets seasick?</strong></a>
You can always choose to come back early, however, since the trip has been made, you will still be charged. Depending on duration of the trip, you may pay less than the full cost of the trip.<br/><br/> 
In order to ensure your good experience, take precautions against motion sickness if you are prone to it. Check with your family physician for medication to suit your needs. Some over-the-counter medications can cause drowsiness, may interact with prescription medications, or could aggravate a health condition. Avoid greasy foods and alcohol the evening prior to and the morning of your charter. Remember, the water doesn't need to be rough to produce motion sickness; a calm day with a slight roll to the water may be all it takes. If you are in doubt at all about whether you may become seasick, follow the above precautions and take medication.<br/><br/>
<a name='whatAboutBadWeather'><strong>What about bad weather or rough water?</strong></a>
Our boats can handle rough water, but often it's not very fun. If charter must be canceled for weather related problems, we will reschedule, whenever possible.<br/><br/> 
<a name='willINeedAFishing'><strong>Will I need a fishing license?</strong></a>
Yes, the Department of Natural Resources requires anyone 17 or older to have a valid fishing license. It can be an all species license or a one-day license, if you are fishing for salmon or trout. Please click here to purchase your license online: http://www.mdnr-elicense.com/welcome.asp<br/><br/>
<a name='doesYouBoatHave'><strong>Does you boat have a bathroom?</strong></a>
Yes, there is a bathroom, a shower and a kitchen with a fridge on the boat for your convenience.<br/><br/> 
<a name='whatTimeWillYou'><strong>What time will you meet us for fishing trip? What time will be come back?</strong></a>
     For morning fishing trips we must leave before sunrise, which may be anywhere between 4:30 am and 6 am. We will confirm exact time with you before the departure. Full day trip will last seven hours, which means you will be back by 2pm the latest. Half-day morning trips are only five hours, allowing your party to be back by noon. Afternoon half-day trips will start at 2pm and last until 7pm. Please arrive early for your charter, so that the departure of your boat is not rushed.<br/><br/> 
<a name='whatIfWeDont'><strong>What if we don&acute;t catch any fish?</strong></a>
We are matching our competitors &acute;promise of&acute; no catch &oline; no fee&acute;. However, you should not worry about catching no fish, as almost always a charter will come back with a plentiful catch. Our boat is specially equipped to locate fish within the lake and river waters, and our staff has years of experience fishing in the area.<br/><br/> 
<a name='howLongInAdvance'><strong>How long in advance should we book the trip? </strong></a>
Please book in advance, as the best dates, such as weekends, get filled quickly. Most popular months are late July and August, and you should contact us as soon as possible to arrange your trip for that time. Weekdays are usually less busy - you should generally be able to book a charter for a sooner date for a weekday.<br/><br/> 
<a name='doesTheRateChange'><strong>Does the rate change depending on the date/day of the week?</strong></a>
No, our rates stay the same. Please contact us ahead of time if you prefer to fish on the weekend, as available dates fill up quickly.<br/><br/> 
<a name='canWeSpendThe'><strong>Can we spend the night on the boat?</strong></a>
You are welcome to spend the night on one of our boats. They are well equipped for overnight stay, and include shower, kitchen, fridge, beds and a heater for your convenience. We will be glad to arrange a custom fishing trip plus overnight stay in the boat for you, please contact us for the details, if you are interested.<br/><br/> 
<a name='whatAboutFood'><strong>What about food? Should we bring our own?</strong></a>
Yes, bring your own food. We do not provide any food, although we do carry bottled water.<br/><br/> 
<a name='areAlcoholicBeverages'><strong>Are alcoholic beverages permitted?</strong></a>
Yes, but if anyone in your party becomes overly intoxicated the charter will be cut short and the full charge for the trip will apply. Your safety is our responsibility.<br/><br/>
<a name='howAndWhereDoWe'><strong>How and where do we clean the fish?</strong></a>
The Captain or the mate will clean and bag your fish. Custom cleaning will have a small fee.<br/><br/>
